          This story takes place in its own universe. It has no connection to
          any of the DC films that have come before it. We see it as a classic
          Warner Bros. movie. Gritty, intimate and oddly funny, the characters
          live in the real world and the stakes are personal. Although it is
          never mentioned in the film, this story takes place in the past. Let's
          call it 1981.

          The page is a script for the movie Joker. For the project was used
          HTML/ CSS for style / and JavaScript for event design. The unique
          feature of the page is that it highlits based on the actor's name. In
          order to do that, there where used couple stepts.
             <ul>
              <li>All the lines of the actors where defined into an array using the DOM</li>
              <li>In order to highlight the lines, a for loop was used through the array with
                an addEventListener.
              </li>
             <li> Finally to make sure only one actor at the time if highlites was used another for loop with 
              if condition, between which actor is highlighted and the line.
             </li>
            </ul>
