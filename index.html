          The page is a script for the movie Joker. For the project was used HTML/ CSS for style / 
          and JavaScript for event design. The unique feature of the page is that it highlights 
          based on the actor's name. To do that, there were used couple steps. </div>

              <li>All the lines of the actors were defined into an array using the DOM</li>
              <li>  To highlight the lines, a for loop was used through the array with an addEventListener.
              </li>
             <li> For the switch between actors, it was used a for loop in combination with an if statement

          This story takes place in its own universe. It has no connection to
          any of the DC films that have come before it. We see it as a classic
          Warner Bros. movie. Gritty, intimate and oddly funny, the characters
          live in the real world and the stakes are personal. Although it is
          never mentioned in the film, this story takes place in the past. Let's
          call it 1981.
